## Introduction

This is a report on 2010 gun murder rates obtained from FBI reports. The original data was obtained from [this Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_in_the_United_States_by_state).

We are going to use the following library:
```{r loading-libs, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```
  
and load the data we already wrangled:

```{r}
load("rda/murders.rda")
```

## Murder rate by state 

We note the large state to state variability by generating a barplot showing the murder rate by state:

```{r murder-rate-by-state, echo=FALSE}
murders %>% mutate(abb = reorder(abb, rate)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(abb, rate)) +
  theme(text = element_text(colour = "gray"),  
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#202020", 
                                       colour = "gray"),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "#0F0F0F", 
                                        color = "darkgrey"),
        panel.grid.major = element_line(colour = "#707070"),
        panel.grid.minor = element_line(colour = "#707070"),
        axis.text = element_text(colour = "lightblue"), 
        axis.ticks =  element_line(colour = "lightblue")) +
  geom_bar(width = 0.5, 
           stat = "identity", 
           color = "#8080C0", 
           fill = "#8080C0") +
  coord_flip()
```

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
